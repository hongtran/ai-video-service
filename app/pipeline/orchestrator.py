"""Real video pipeline: sequences the steps and owns every job state
transition. Expected failures surface as status=FAILED with
error_message = "<step>: <reason>"; only genuine bugs escape to the worker.

Split-first flow: the script is segmented into scenes (Pass 1) BEFORE the audio
exists; captions are derived in code so they equal the script exactly. TTS then
speaks the script, Whisper gives word timing, and each scene's typed data is
authored per-scene (Pass 2). Alignment is best-effort (never re-splits), so the
only retry loop is the layout gate, which re-authors just the offending scenes.
